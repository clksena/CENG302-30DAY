# CENG302-30DAY
This repository is created as part of the CENG302 Software Engineering course at Pamukkale University. It is intended for tracking GitHub activity over a 30-workday period as required by the course.

"Throughout the semester, I will be uploading the projects I develop to improve my skills and gain hands-on experience in software engineering. This repository will serve as a portfolio of my learning journey and progress as part of the CENG302 course at Pamukkale University."
